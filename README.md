## Description & General Info
This project uses React (JSX) to create an interactive gameboard to play Tik-Tac-Toe by updating state between parent and child components.

## Languages & Technologies
- React / JSX
- CSS
- Node.js

## Setup & Use
1. Download or clone the project repository
2. Navigate to the directory of the project from your command line.
3. Run `npm start` in your commmand line. (Make sure you have Node installed!) This should start the project in a new tab of your default broswer.
4. Click on the tiles to play tik tac toe! 

## Suggestions for Improvements
- Currently, only the "x" and "o" player indicator mark change color on the board, but one functionality imporvement could be to change the background color of the square when a player clicks it. Additional functionality could include the players being able to pick their square background color or the color of their marker. 
- An additional improvement could be that after the game has ended and a winner has been announced, there could be a button that is enabled to restart/play another game. 
- The current functionality is only designed for when there is a winner of the game, so additional code could be added to handle a tied game.
